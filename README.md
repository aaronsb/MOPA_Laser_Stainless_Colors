# MOPA_Laser_Stainless_Colors
MOPA laser settings to make colorful oxide layers on stainless steel

I used a Cloudray GM100 MOPA laser engraver with 290mm focal length F-theta lens :  https://www.cloudraylaser.com/products/cloudray-gm-100-litemarker-100w-fiber-laser-marking-engraver-with-4-3-x-4-3-scan-area?variant=43545779830945

All substrates are polished stainless steel. .048"  (1.2mm) is great because it doesn't warp much.  .036" (0.9mm) is acceptable, but thinner metal has a lot of problems with warping.   https://www.mcmaster.com/9785K12/   https://www.mcmaster.com/9785K13/     I used a vacuum chuck to hold the sheet metal flat while engraving:  https://www.ebay.com/itm/276754053418  https://www.clampusystems.com/product-category/vacuum-tables/sg-vacuum-table-series/
